# Device Sentry
This is a tiny application that reports device changes in real time.

Some PC games (like Elden Ring) will experience framerate drops or other issues when a device's properties are changed, even if that device isn't necessary for the game. This application logs the times and nature of all device changes so that you can determine what is causing the issue.

## System Requirements
This has only been tested on an up-to-date Windows 11 machine, but it should work on Windows 10 as well.
